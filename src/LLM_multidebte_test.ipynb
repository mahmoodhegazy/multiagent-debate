Since there are 19 houses on a block, the calculation should be straightforward:\\n\\nEach block gets 38 pieces of junk mail, regardless of how many houses there are in each block. Therefore, the calculation of distributing the total junk mail across all houses doesn\\'t directly apply based on the intended meaning of the problem statement. \\n\\nInstead, we calculate pieces of junk mail each house should get on the assumption that the 38 pieces of junk mail are to be evenly divided among the 19 houses in a block:\\n\\nPieces of junk mail per house = 38 / 19\\n\\nPieces of junk mail per house = 2 \\n\\nSo, each house should receive 2 pieces of junk mail.\\n\\n```\\nFinal Answer: \\n    \"Answer\": {\"2\"},\\n```', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

            "Agent 2 Response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Upon reviewing the solution provided by Agent 1, it indicates a correct approach to solving the problem by analyzing the ratio between flour and sugar, as given in the recipe and the amounts added by Mary. \\n\\nThe problem statement specifies that the recipe calls for a flour-to-sugar ratio of 5:14. When Mary uses 10 cups of flour instead of the 5 cups as the recipe specifies, she indeed doubles the amount from the recipe. Hence, to maintain the specified ratio, she needs to double the amount of sugar as well, from 14 cups to 28 cups. Given that Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar, she needs to add an additional 26 cups to meet the requirements of the recipe based on the doubled amounts of flour she used.\\n\\nThere does not appear to be an error in Agent 1\\'s reasoning or calculation. The approach leverages the concept of ratios correctly and does not introduce complexity that deviates from solving the question. Instead, it provides a step-by-step solution that properly addresses the provided information and arrives at a conclusion based on mathematical reasoning.\\n\\nThus, in this instance, arguing that Agent 1 has made the question complex by misinterpreting the information would not be accurate.
